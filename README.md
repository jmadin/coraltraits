# Database procedures
***

The Coral Trait Database is an open source research initiative that aims to make all observations and measurements of corals accessible in order to more rapidly advance coral reef science. Anyone collecting coral trait data (e.g., collected in field and laboratory studies, extracted from the literature, or by other means) can join and contribute to the growing data compilation. Contributors have control over the privacy of their data and greatly benefit from being able to download complementary public data from the database in a standard format for use in their analyses. We hope that private data will become public once the contributor has published them in a paper, which will subsequently be cited when their data are used in analyses by other people. We have carefully designed a citation system that ensures full transparency about the origin of each individual data point as well as larger data compilations and compilations of other peoples' data (such as data extracted from literature). By becoming a data contributor, you become a member of the Coral Trait Database Consortium.

# Traits

> The Coral Traits Consortium is flexible about the definition of trait.

A true trait is a heritable quality of an organism. However, including species-level characteristics, such as geographical range size and conservation status, in the same database makes analyses of true traits much more effective. In addition, the database captures contextual (ancillary) data about the environment in which a trait measurement was recorded (i.e., "traits" of habitat, seawater or an experiment). Contextual "traits" are important for understanding true traits (e.g., as predictors or co-variates in analyses). Individual-level (true) traits, species-level characteristics and contextual data are all considered traits in the database.

### Current traits

> The current list of traits can be found *[here](http://coraltraits.org/traits)*.

### What information can be contributed?

The database currently accepts individual-level and species-level measurements of both zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate Schleractinain corals. 

> Public data must be citable.

Unpublished can also be imported into the database if it is kept private. Private data can be made public once published and associated with a resource. The benefit of accepting unpublished data is the ability for the owner to download the data alongside other public data in the database for analysis. The other benefit is improved data longevity.

`Individual-level` measurements typically include other measurements of the environment that provide useful context. One (or more) trait measurements of a coral and other contextual measurements are bound together as an observation. For example, an measurement of [larval swimming speed](/observations/97883) was measured within the context of swimming direction and water temperature, both of which provide important information about the swimming speed.

`Species-level` measurements are either traits that do not vary among individuals (such as [zooxanthellate](/traits/41) and [sexual system](/traits/8)) or emergent characteristics of individuals within a species (such as geographical [range size](/traits/138), [conservation status](/traits/77), [wave exposure preference](/traits/96) and [lower depth](/traits/92)).

### Observations and measurements

Observations bind related measurements. For example, observing the same coral and measuring its height and weight results in one observation with two measurement (each corresponing with a different trait of the coral). If water temperature was also measurement, then this also belongs to the same observation, but as a contextual trait.

`Observation-level` data include the coral species, location and resource. These data are the same for all measurements corresponding to the observation.

`Measurement-level` data include the trait, value, standard (unit), methodology, and estimates of precision (if applicable).

### Required data

When entering or importing trait data, the following is required.

- Observation-level
  - User
  - Access
  - Coral
  - Location
  - *Resource 

*Resource can be left blank for unpublished data, but data must be kept private.

- Measurement-level
  - Trait
  - Value
  - Standard

# Protocols for contributing someone else's data

Entering published data not already in the database in strongely encouraged to improve the data's longevity and augment potential analyses. A case in which this might occur is a meta-analysis. The data enterer may wish to keep the data private until their study is published.

> The key ojective is to extract the data in such a way as to avoid people ever needing to go back to the resource again.

For example, taking only the mean value of a trait from a paper, without any measure of variation or context of where the trait was measured, will mean that the data are useless for most purposes. Someone else will need to go back and extract the other information.

### Protocols

- **Primary resources only.** Often people enter data from summary tables in papers that come from other primary resources. It is important to enter the data from the primary resource for two reasons: (1) so that the primary resource's author is credited for their work, and (2) to avoid data duplication, where the same data are entered from both the primary and secondary resource. Secondary resources, such as meta-analyses, can be credited for accummulating data by using database [citation manager](/citations).

- **Careful extraction.** Copy values from tables carefully and double check. Extracting data from figures can be done with software like ImageJ, where a scale can be set based on axis values and measurements of plotted data made.

- **Gather important context.** Enter contextual data as well. This might be as simple as the depth at which corals were measured and the same for all observations. However, contextual information can get complicated quickly.  For example, when the area of a colony is measured each year for 10 years, context will include an [indivudal identifier](/traits/172) to capture that they same colony was measured, as well as the [year](/traits/174) to determine the order in which measurements were made. Examples of capture a range of contextual situations can be found on the [Imports](/imports/observations) page.

Will we allow unpublished data?

- Why? 
- Useful to have your data alongside other data in database. 
- More likely to contribute data at end of project

- Easier to identify duplications?

BUT 

- how much work on back end?
- Limit to cases where you are collector
- Unclear - will coral traits be primary source?

### Published data

- Available in digital form with DOI 
  - port initial
  - modifications
- Available in spreadsheet, no DOI (via email)
  - spreadsheet template / upload 
- Only in print (dark data)


# For users

- how to import into R, reshape code
- citation requirements/recommendation (original sources, database) (we canâ€™t enforce anything, just encourage best practice, also encourage reviewers/editors to enforce this )
- recommendations for reproducible research
- how to provide feedback on errors, data quality etc (see below)
- helpdesk?

# Major question: Do we make ourselves expendable or essential?, i.e. 
- commit to providing long-term access 
 - register as recognised archival location?
 - solid API
 - long-term commitment
- OR, make coraltraits.org expendenable
 - all data archived elsewhere

### Version control and archiving

- Github

Of data and API

Present possible options to technical advisory board and get feedback.

Aim: to provide stable API and versioning within 3 months, i.e. before data paper is released

Option1:

Add date to database query.  So can replicate download in the future for a particular analysis.

Option 2:


# Quality control

Three levels of data review.

1. Contributor level at time of submission
2. Editorial review of user contributions by curator
3. User feedback (issues reporting) with notification back to trait editor

- look first for approval by original curator first, then after given to next in line (curator)
- archive discussions around this so that transparent

### Error checking

- automated tests: allowed values
- duplications: flags, does this ref already exist

### Engagement with potential users

### Strategy

### End users

- Scientists
- Reef monitoring programs (e.g., Austalian Insitute of Marine Science)

### Data distributors

Need review

- Trait bank
- RopenSci

# Recording usage

Website and data download activity are tracked using Google Analytics


### Uploading data

> We welcome the import of any and all coral trait data. You maintain control over the data's privacy.

Our only requirement is that data must be published before it can become public.

### New corals tightly controlled


### Global estimate (location)





 collected (i.e., where contributor gleaned the data from the literature)



- Porting data published elsewhere (e.g., dryad)
- Templates for uploading
- Flag data that are duplicated / errors etc for approval

### Data sources

# Database design
    
The Coral Trait Database has been developed according to the Observation and Measurement Ontology (OBOE) that was developed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (see references below).  The system has been designed with reef corals in mind, but is a generic system for data in which entities are observed, and then traits of these entities are measured. The key distinction between OBOE and other observational models is that trait-entity relationships and observation context are made explicit. In other words, the database preserves metadata about data values as well as the standard metadata about datasets.

Several contextual constraints have been implemented in the Coral Trait Database to simplify the structure and improve speed. For example, we model only five observed entities: User, Resource, Location, Time and Coral.  Measurements of "traits" can be taken of all five entities; however, we constrain the measureable traits for the first four of these entities.  Measurements of "traits" for Coral are highly flexible. Also for simplicity, many contextual entities, such as "habitat" or "plot", are measured at the Coral entity level. For example, a Coral "planar area" (i.e., colony size) can be measured as expected, but so can traits for contextual entities such as "water temperature", "depth" and "habitat".  Such constraints on the model can be relaxed if necessary, but are in place to improve the performance of the model for current purposes.

# License

- Sci Data requires data released under CC0 to promote potential reuse. Need to ensure all sources comply.
- If allowing unpublished / private data, need to ensure one-way public access to avoid broken datasets (this the way CC0 works, once applied cannot be revoked)
