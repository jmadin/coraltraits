      <h1>The Coral Trait Database</h3></h1>
    </div>


    <p>The Coral Trait Database is an open source research initiative that aims to make all observations and measurements of corals accessible in order to more rapidly advance coral reef science. Anyone collecting coral trait data (e.g., collected in field and laboratory studies, extracted from the literature, or by other means) can join and contribute to the growing data compilation. Contributors have control over the privacy of their data and greatly benefit from being able to download complementary public data from the database in a standard format for use in their analyses. We hope that private data will become visible to other database users once the contributor has published a paper, which will  be cited when their data are used in subsequent analyses by other people.  We have carefully designed a citation system that ensures full transparency about the origin of each individual data point as well as larger data compilations and compilations of other peoples' data (such as data extracted from literature). By becoming a contributor, you become a member of the Coral Trait Database Consortium (something for the CV).</p>

    <h3>Database trait editors</h3>

    <p>The Coral Trait Database replies on expert volunteers who monitor contributions to the database. Editors are assigned one or more traits to monitor for data quality. If you add a new trait to the database, you might be asked to volunteer as the editor for this trait.  Editors are automatically emailed when new data for their traits are entered. The current editors are:</p>

    <h3>Database design</h3>
    
    <p>The Coral Trait Database has been developed according to the Observation and Measurement Ontology (OBOE) that was developed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (see references below).  The system has been designed with reef corals in mind, but is a generic system for data in which entities are observed, and then traits of these entities are measured.  The key distinction between OBOE and other observational models is that trait-entity relationships and observation context are made explicit.  On other words, the database preserves metadata about data values as well as the standard metadata about datasets.</p>

    <p>Several contextual constraints have been implemented in the Coral Trait Database to simplify the structure and improve speed. For example, we model only five observed entities: User, Resource, Location, Time and Coral.  Measurements of "traits" can be taken of all five entities; however, we constrain the measureable traits for the first four of these entities.  Measurements of "traits" for Coral are highly flexible.  Also for simplicity, many contextual entities, such as "habitat" or "plot", are measured at the Coral entity level.  For example, a Coral "planar area" (i.e., colony size) can be measured as expected, but so can traits for higher-level entities such as "water temperature", "depth" and "habitat".  Such constraints on the model can be relaxed if necessary, but are in place to improve the performance of the model for current purposes.</p>
