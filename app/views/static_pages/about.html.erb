    </div>


    <p>The Coral Trait Database is a community initiative focused on making all observations and measurements of corals accessible in order to more rapidly advance coral reef science. Database contributors have control over the privacy of their data.</p>

    <h3>Database trait editors</h3>

    <p>The Coral Trait Database replies on expert volunteers who monitor contributions to the database. The current editors are:</p>

    <h3>Database design</h3>
    
    <p>The Coral Trait Database has been developed according to the Observation and Measurement Ontology (OBOE) that was developed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (see references below).  The system has been designed with reef corals in mind, but is a generic system for data in which entities are observed, and then traits of these entities are measured.  The key distinction between OBOE and other observational models is that trait-entity relationships and observation context are made explicit.  On other words, the database preserves metadata about data values as well as the standard metadata about datasets.</p>

    <p>Several contextual constraints have been implemented in the Coral Trait Database to simplify the structure and improve speed. For example, we model only five observed entities: User, Resource, Location, Time and Coral.  Measurements of "traits" can be taken of all five entities; however, we constrain the measureable traits for the first four of these entities.  Measurements of "traits" for Coral are highly flexible.  Also for simplicity, many contextual entities, such as "habitat" or "plot", are measured at the Coral entity level.  For example, a Coral "planar area" (i.e., colony size) can be measured as expected, but so can traits for higher-level entities such as "water temperature", "depth" and "habitat".  Such constraints on the model can be relaxed if necessary, but are in place to improve the performance of the model for current purposes.</p>
