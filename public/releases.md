Releases ensure that ongoing changes to the database do not disrupt analyses. A release is a static snapshot of the database, that can correspond with a major change (that may effect compatability with older releases), minor change (data updates for traits or new trait releases) of patches (e.g., data error fixes) (see [Sementic Versioning](http://semver.org) for details). 

Releases can be downloaded below as compressed folders containing the data release and associated resources. Additionally, you can access release data directly for analyses (e.g., using R, see <a href="/download">Download</a> for details) using a variant of the .csv, /resources.csv or .zip formats as follows:

- <https://coraltraits.org/releases/ctdb_0.1.0.zip> returns the zipped folder with both data and resource files.
- <https://coraltraits.org/releases/ctdb_0.1.0.csv> returns the data in CSV format.
- <https://coraltraits.org/releases/ctdb_0.1.0/resources.csv> returns the resources corresponding with the data in CSV format.
