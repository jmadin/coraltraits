Because the database is constantly changing, snapshots (versions) are released to ensure changes do not disrupt analyses. Snapshots will be released periodically, typically in association with a trait release. Snapshots can be downloaded below as compressed folders containing the data release and associated resources. Additionally, you can access snapshot data directly for analyses (e.g., using R, see <a href="/download">Download</a> for details) using a variant of the .csv, /resources.csv or .zip formats as follows:

- <https://coraltraits.org/snapshots/ctdb_20150616.csv> returns the data in CSV format.
- <https://coraltraits.org/snapshots/ctdb_20150616/resources.csv> returns the resources corresponding with the data.
- <https://coraltraits.org/snapshots/ctdb_20150616.zip> returns the zipped folder with both data and resource files.
